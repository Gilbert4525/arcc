```

### **Step 2: Schedule Cron Job**

```json
// vercel.json
{
  "crons": [

      "path": "/api/cron/process-voting-notifications",
      "schedule": "*/1 * * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Option B: External Cron**
```bash
# Run every minute
* * * * * curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/cron/process-voting-notifications \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
```
