# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical issues in the Arc Board Management System's voting functionality where board member votes and comments are not properly reflecting in the system, along with console errors affecting user experience. The system currently has problems with vote persistence, comment display in admin views, and various console warnings that need to be resolved.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Vote Persistence and Display

**User Story:** As a board member, I want my votes to be properly saved and displayed so that I can see my voting history and admins can track voting progress accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a board member submits a vote THEN the vote SHALL be immediately saved to the database
2. WHEN a board member submits a vote THEN the vote SHALL be immediately reflected in the voting UI
3. WHEN a board member refreshes the page THEN their previously submitted vote SHALL still be displayed
4. WHEN an admin views voting progress THEN all board member votes SHALL be accurately counted and displayed
5. IF a board member changes their vote THEN the system SHALL update the existing vote record rather than creating a duplicate

### Requirement 2: Comment System Functionality

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to see all board member comments on minutes so that I can understand the reasoning behind votes and address any concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a board member submits a comment with their vote THEN the comment SHALL be saved to the database
2. WHEN an admin clicks "View Comments" THEN all comments from board members SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN an admin views the minutes list THEN minutes with comments SHALL show a comment count badge
4. WHEN the system calculates comment statistics THEN the counts SHALL be accurate and up-to-date
5. IF a board member updates their vote and comment THEN the comment SHALL be updated accordingly

### Requirement 3: Real-time Updates and Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the voting interface to stay synchronized with the latest data so that I see accurate voting progress and my actions are immediately reflected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a vote is submitted THEN the voting statistics SHALL be immediately updated in the UI
2. WHEN multiple users are voting simultaneously THEN each user SHALL see updated vote counts
3. WHEN a user submits a vote THEN the system SHALL refresh the data to ensure accuracy
4. IF there are network issues THEN the system SHALL retry operations and show appropriate error messages
5. WHEN vote data is fetched THEN the system SHALL handle loading states gracefully

### Requirement 4: Console Error Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate console errors and warnings so that the application runs cleanly and debugging is easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN there SHALL be no manifest icon errors in the console
2. WHEN realtime subscriptions are used THEN they SHALL properly connect and disconnect without errors
3. WHEN components unmount THEN realtime subscriptions SHALL be properly cleaned up
4. IF realtime connections fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without breaking functionality
5. WHEN the service worker registers THEN it SHALL not produce console warnings

### Requirement 5: Data Consistency and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the voting system to handle errors gracefully and maintain data consistency so that votes are never lost or duplicated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a vote submission fails THEN the user SHALL see a clear error message and be able to retry
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL log errors appropriately and provide user feedback
3. WHEN vote counts are calculated THEN they SHALL always match the actual vote records in the database
4. IF concurrent votes are submitted THEN the system SHALL handle them without creating duplicate records
5. WHEN the system recovers from errors THEN vote data SHALL remain consistent and accurate
