# Minutes Voting Enhancements - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines enhancements to the existing minutes voting system to improve transparency and usability for both administrators and board members. The current system allows board members to vote on minutes but lacks comprehensive comment visibility for admins and detailed content access for board members.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Admin Comment Visibility

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to see all board member comments made during minutes voting, so that I can understand their concerns, feedback, and needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin views minutes in the admin section THEN the system SHALL display all board member voting comments
2. WHEN a board member submits a vote with a comment THEN the system SHALL store the comment with the voter's identity
3. WHEN displaying voting comments to admins THEN the system SHALL show the board member's name, vote choice, comment text, and timestamp
4. WHEN no comments are provided for a vote THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate "No comment provided"
5. WHEN multiple board members vote on the same minutes THEN the system SHALL display all comments in chronological order
6. WHEN an admin views voting results THEN the system SHALL provide a dedicated section for viewing all voting comments

### Requirement 2: Board Member Minutes Detail Access

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a board member views minutes available for voting THEN the system SHALL provide access to view full minutes content
2. WHEN a board member clicks to view minutes details THEN the system SHALL display the complete meeting content, key decisions, and action items
3. WHEN viewing minutes details THEN the system SHALL show meeting date, title, full content, key decisions, and action items in a readable format
4. WHEN a board member is viewing minutes details THEN the system SHALL provide voting options directly within the detail view
5. WHEN minutes include key decisions THEN the system SHALL display them in a clearly formatted section
6. WHEN minutes include action items THEN the system SHALL display them in a clearly formatted section
7. WHEN a board member has already voted THEN the system SHALL still allow viewing of minutes details but show their existing vote

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Admin Minutes Management

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to see comprehensive voting analytics and comments in the minutes management interface, so that I can better understand board member engagement and concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin views the minutes management dashboard THEN the system SHALL display voting comment counts for each minutes
2. WHEN an admin clicks on a minutes item THEN the system SHALL show detailed voting breakdown including all comments
3. WHEN viewing voting details THEN the system SHALL group comments by vote type (approve, reject, abstain)
4. WHEN a board member provides feedback through comments THEN the system SHALL highlight minutes with comments for admin attention
5. WHEN viewing completed voting THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of all feedback and concerns raised

### Requirement 4: Improved Board Member Voting Interface

**User Story:** As a board member, I want an intuitive interface to review minutes and provide meaningful feedback, so that I can participate effectively in the governance process.

#### Acceptance Criteria
