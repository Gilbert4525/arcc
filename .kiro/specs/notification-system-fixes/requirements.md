# Notification System Fixes - Requirements

## Introduction

The notification system is currently not working properly because API routes for documents, meetings, and resolutions are not creating notifications when items are added or updated. Users need to receive both in-app notifications and web push notifications when important events occur.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Notifications

**User Story:** As a board member, I want to receive notifications when new documents are published or updated so that I can stay informed about important board materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin uploads a new document THEN all board members SHALL receive a notification
2. WHEN a document is published THEN all board members SHALL receive a notification
3. WHEN a document is updated THEN all board members SHALL receive a notification
4. WHEN I receive a document notification THEN it SHALL include the document title and a link to view it
5. WHEN a document notification is created THEN it SHALL be sent via web push if enabled

### Requirement 2: Meeting Notifications

**User Story:** As a board member, I want to receive notifications when meetings are scheduled, updated, or cancelled so that I can manage my schedule effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new meeting is created THEN all participants SHALL receive a notification
2. WHEN a meeting is updated THEN all participants SHALL receive a notification
3. WHEN a meeting is cancelled THEN all participants SHALL receive a notification
4. WHEN I receive a meeting notification THEN it SHALL include the meeting title, date, and a link to view details
5. WHEN a meeting notification is created THEN it SHALL be sent via web push if enabled

### Requirement 3: Resolution Notifications

**User Story:** As a board member, I want to receive notifications when resolutions are published for voting so that I can participate in board decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new resolution is created THEN all board members SHALL receive a notification
2. WHEN a resolution is published for voting THEN all eligible voters SHALL receive a notification
3. WHEN a resolution voting deadline is approaching THEN voters SHALL receive reminder notifications
4. WHEN I receive a resolution notification THEN it SHALL include the resolution title and a link to vote
5. WHEN a resolution notification is created THEN it SHALL be sent via web push if enabled

### Requirement 4: Web Push Notifications

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive web push notifications for important events so that I'm notified even when not actively using the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enable web push notifications THEN I SHALL receive browser notifications for new events
2. WHEN I click on a web push notification THEN it SHALL take me to the relevant page in the application
3. WHEN web push is not supported THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to in-app notifications only
4. WHEN I disable web push notifications THEN I SHALL only receive in-app notifications
5. WHEN a web push notification fails THEN it SHALL not prevent the in-app notification from being created

### Requirement 5: Notification Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the notification system to be properly integrated with all API endpoints so that notifications are created automatically when events occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API endpoint creates or updates an entity THEN it SHALL create appropriate notifications
2. WHEN notifications are created THEN they SHALL be sent to the correct users based on their roles and permissions
3. WHEN notification creation fails THEN it SHALL not prevent the main operation from completing
4. WHEN notifications are created THEN they SHALL include proper metadata for tracking and debugging
5. WHEN the system creates bulk notifications THEN it SHALL handle them efficiently without performance issues
