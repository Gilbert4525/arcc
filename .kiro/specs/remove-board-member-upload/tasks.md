# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update sidebar navigation to hide upload link from board members


  - Modify DashboardSidebar component to change roles array from `['admin', 'board_member']` to `['admin']` for the "Upload Documents" navigation item
  - Test that board members no longer see the upload link in sidebar navigation
  - Verify that admins still see the upload link in sidebar navigation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1_

- [x] 2. Hide upload button in DocumentManagement component for board members



  - Update DocumentManagement component to conditionally render the "Upload Document" button only when `userRole === 'admin'`
  - Ensure all other functionality (view, download, filter, edit, delete) remains available for board members
  - Verify that admins still see the upload button and all functionality works
  - Test that board members can still access all document viewing and downloading features
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.2, 3.3_
