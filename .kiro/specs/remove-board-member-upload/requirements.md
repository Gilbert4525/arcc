# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves removing document upload functionality from board members while maintaining it exclusively for administrators. This change enforces proper role-based access control where only admins can upload documents, while board members have read-only access to view and download published documents.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want only admin users to have document upload capabilities, so that document management is centrally controlled and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a board member accesses the dashboard THEN they SHALL NOT see any document upload functionality
2. WHEN a board member navigates to document-related pages THEN they SHALL only see view and download options
3. WHEN an admin accesses the dashboard THEN they SHALL continue to have full document upload capabilities
4. WHEN a board member attempts to access upload URLs directly THEN the system SHALL redirect them or show access denied

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a board member, I want to clearly understand that I cannot upload documents, so that I know to contact administrators for document uploads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a board member views document management pages THEN they SHALL see clear messaging about admin-only upload privileges
2. WHEN a board member needs to upload a document THEN they SHALL have clear guidance on how to request admin assistance
3. WHEN the document management interface loads for board members THEN it SHALL show only viewing and downloading capabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to maintain all existing document upload functionality, so that I can continue managing documents effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses document management THEN they SHALL see all existing upload functionality
2. WHEN an admin uploads documents THEN the process SHALL work exactly as before
3. WHEN an admin manages documents THEN they SHALL have full CRUD capabilities as currently implemented

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system, I want to enforce role-based access control at multiple levels, so that security is maintained even if users attempt direct access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar navigation renders THEN it SHALL only show upload links to admin users
2. WHEN upload pages are accessed directly THEN they SHALL check user roles and restrict access appropriately
3. WHEN document management components render THEN they SHALL hide upload functionality based on user role
4. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL maintain existing role-based security checks
