# Design Document

## Overview

This design outlines the simple removal of document upload functionality from board members' UI while preserving it for administrators. Since role-based access control already exists at the API level, we only need to update the frontend components to hide upload functionality from board members.

## Architecture

The changes will be implemented at two simple layers:

1. **Navigation Layer**: Remove "Upload Documents" link from sidebar for board members
2. **Component Layer**: Hide upload button in DocumentManagement component for board members

## Components and Interfaces

### Navigation Components

**DashboardSidebar Component**
- Update the roles array for the "Upload Documents" navigation item from `['admin', 'board_member']` to `['admin']`
- This will automatically hide the upload link from board members
- No other changes needed - existing role filtering logic will handle this

### Document Management Component

**DocumentManagement Component Updates**
- Hide the "Upload Document" button in the header actions when `userRole !== 'admin'`
- Maintain all existing viewing, downloading, and filtering functionality for board members
- Preserve all existing functionality for admin users
- No additional messaging needed - clean and simple approach

## Data Models

No changes to existing data models are required. The existing role-based security at the API level remains intact.

## Error Handling

No additional error handling needed since we're only hiding UI elements. The existing API-level security will handle any edge cases.

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing
1. **Board Member Flow**: Login as board member, verify upload button and navigation link are hidden
2. **Admin Flow**: Login as admin, verify all upload functionality still works
3. **Functionality**: Ensure all other document features work normally for both roles

## Implementation Approach

### Simple Two-Step Process
1. Update DashboardSidebar component to restrict upload navigation to admins only
2. Update DocumentManagement component to hide upload button for board members

This approach is minimal, safe, and leverages the existing role-based infrastructure without introducing complexity or potential errors.
