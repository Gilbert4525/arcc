# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current notification system excludes admin users from receiving board member notifications because it filters recipients by role = 'board_member' only. This creates a gap where admins, who need to stay informed about all board activities, don't receive important communications like voting summaries, meeting notifications, and other board-related emails. This feature will ensure admins can receive all relevant notifications while maintaining proper role-based access controls.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to receive all board member notifications, so that I can stay informed about board activities and ensure proper oversight.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a notification is sent to board members THEN the system SHALL also include admin users in the recipient list
2. WHEN an admin has notification preferences enabled THEN they SHALL receive the same notifications as board members
3. WHEN the test notification button is clicked THEN admins SHALL receive the test email along with board members
4. WHEN voting summary emails are sent THEN admins SHALL be included in the recipient list

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to control my notification preferences independently, so that I can choose which types of notifications I receive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses notification settings THEN they SHALL see all available notification types
2. WHEN an admin disables a notification type THEN they SHALL not receive those notifications even if board members do
3. WHEN an admin enables a notification type THEN they SHALL receive those notifications along with board members
4. IF an admin has notifications disabled THEN the system SHALL respect their preference and not send notifications

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the notification system to be role-aware but inclusive, so that all relevant users receive appropriate communications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN determining notification recipients THEN the system SHALL include both 'admin' and 'board_member' roles
2. WHEN filtering by notification preferences THEN the system SHALL check individual user preferences regardless of role
3. WHEN sending role-specific notifications THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing board member notifications
4. WHEN logging notification activities THEN the system SHALL record which roles received each notification type

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the notification system to be maintainable and extensible, so that future role additions don't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new user roles THEN the notification system SHALL be easily configurable to include or exclude them
2. WHEN modifying notification logic THEN the changes SHALL be centralized and reusable across all notification types
3. WHEN testing notifications THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about which users received notifications
4. WHEN debugging notification issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging of recipient selection logic
