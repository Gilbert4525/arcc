```

### 3. Create Admin User

1. Go to your Supabase project Authentication tab
2. Create a new user with your email and password
3. After user creation, go to the SQL Editor and run:

```sql
-- Update the user role to admin (replace with your user's email)
UPDATE public.profiles 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and you'll be redirected to the login page.
