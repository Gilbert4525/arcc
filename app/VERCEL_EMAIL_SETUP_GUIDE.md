# üìß Vercel Email Configuration Guide

## üö® **CRITICAL: Email System Not Working in Production**

Your Arc Board Management system emails are not working because **Vercel doesn't have access to Gmail SMTP credentials**. This guide will fix the issue.

## üîß **Step 1: Configure Environment Variables in Vercel**

### **Required Environment Variables:**
```bash
GMAIL_EMAIL=boardmixllc@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=aevg xppw kzhs vmjz
```

### **How to Add to Vercel:**

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your `arc-board-management` project

2. **Navigate to Settings:**
   - Click on "Settings" tab
   - Click on "Environment Variables" in the sidebar

3. **Add Gmail Email:**
   - Name: `GMAIL_EMAIL`
   - Value: `boardmixllc@gmail.com`
   - Environment: Select "Production", "Preview", and "Development"
   - Click "Save"

4. **Add Gmail App Password:**
   - Name: `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`
   - Value: `aevg xppw kzhs vmjz`
   - Environment: Select "Production", "Preview", and "Development"
   - Click "Save"

## üöÄ **Step 2: Redeploy Your Application**

After adding environment variables, you MUST redeploy:

1. **Trigger Redeploy:**

   - Click "..." on the latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"
   - OR push a new commit to trigger automatic deployment

2. **Wait for Deployment:**

   - Check deployment logs for any errors

## ‚úÖ **Step 3: Validate Email Configuration**

After redeployment, test the email system:

1. **Access Admin Dashboard:**
   - Go to your production URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app/admin`
   - Login as admin

2. **Run Email Validation:**
   - Scroll to "Email System Testing" section
   - Click "Validate Email Configuration"
   - Check all status indicators are green ‚úÖ

3. **Send Test Email:**
   - Click "Test Gmail SMTP" button
   - Check if test email is received

## üîç **Step 4: Troubleshooting**

### **If Validation Shows Red ‚ùå:**

**Environment Variables Missing:**
- Double-check Vercel environment variables are saved
- Ensure you selected all environments (Production, Preview, Development)
- Redeploy after adding variables

**Gmail Service Can't Initialize:**
- Verify Gmail App Password is correct: `aevg xppw kzhs vmjz`
- Check Gmail account settings allow app passwords
- Ensure 2FA is enabled on Gmail account

**Connection Failed:**
- Test Gmail credentials manually
- Check if Gmail account is locked or suspended
- Verify app password hasn't expired

### **Common Issues:**

1. **"Environment variables missing"**
   - Solution: Add variables to Vercel dashboard and redeploy

2. **"Gmail SMTP connection failed"**
   - Solution: Verify app password and Gmail settings

3. **"Dynamic import failed"**
   - Solution: Check Vercel function logs for import errors

## üìä **Step 5: Monitor Email System**

### **Production Monitoring:**

1. **Check Vercel Function Logs:**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Functions
   - Monitor for email-related errors

2. **Use Admin Validation Tool:**
   - Run validation weekly to ensure system health
   - Check after any deployments

3. **Test Email Notifications:**
   - Create test resolutions/minutes
   - Verify board members receive emails

## üîê **Security Best Practices**

### **Environment Variable Security:**
- ‚úÖ Gmail App Password is used (not main password)
- ‚úÖ Variables are encrypted in Vercel
- ‚úÖ Access restricted to admin functions only

### **Gmail Account Security:**

  - Voting reminders
