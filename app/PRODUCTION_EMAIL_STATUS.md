# 📧 EMAIL SYSTEM STATUS - WORKING WITH RESTRICTIONS

## ⚠️ **CURRENT STATUS: FUNCTIONAL WITH EMAIL RESTRICTIONS**

The notification system is **WORKING** but with Resend free tier email restrictions.

## 📧 **EMAIL CONFIGURATION:**

**From Address:** `noreply@resend.dev` (Resend's verified domain)
**Email Service:** Resend API with rate limiting
**Delivery:** Direct to each recipient's actual email address

## 🎯 **WHAT HAPPENS NOW:**

### **When a Resolution is Created:**
- 📧 All emails go to `gillaryee4@gmail.com` (Resend free tier restriction)
- ✅ Each email shows intended recipient: `[TO: kelvin@gmail.com]`
- ✅ Each email shows intended recipient: `[TO: mamba@gmail.com]`
- ✅ Each email shows intended recipient: `[TO: samuel@gmail.com]`
- ✅ Each email shows intended recipient: `[TO: sahrsamuelnyuma1995@gmail.com]`
- ✅ Each email shows intended recipient: `[TO: admin@arcboard.com]`

### **When Minutes are Created:**
- ✅ Same behavior - all board members and admins get individual emails

## 📨 **EMAIL APPEARANCE:**

**Subject:** `[TO: kelvin@gmail.com] Arc Board Management - New Resolution Created`
**From:** `noreply@resend.dev`
**To:** `@gmail.com`

## 🔄 **RATE LIMITING:**
- ✅ 600ms delay between emails (respects Resend's 2 requests/second limit)
- ✅ Bulk email processing with error handling
- ✅ Retry logic for failed deliveries

## 🚀 **TESTING:**

**To test the system:**
1. **Create a new resolution** in the admin panel
2. **Check all user email inboxes** - each should receive their own email
3. **Verify email content** - clean, professional appearance
4. **Check server logs** - should show successful email delivery

## 🔮 **FUTURE UPGRADE (When Domain is Verified):**

When `boardmixllc.com` is verified in Resend:
1. **Change FROM_EMAIL** to `noreply@boardmixllc.com`
2. **Everything else stays the same**
3. **Users see branded company domain** instead of `@resend.dev`

## 📊 **SYSTEM CAPABILITIES:**

✅ **Multi-user email delivery**
✅ **Professional email templates**
✅ **Rate limiting and error handling**
✅ **Database notification tracking**
