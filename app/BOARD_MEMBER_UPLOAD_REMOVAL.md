# Board Member Upload Functionality Removal

## Overview
Successfully removed document upload functionality from board members while maintaining it for administrators. This change enforces proper role-based access control where only admins can upload documents.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard Sidebar Navigation
**File:** `app/src/components/layout/DashboardSidebar.tsx`
- Updated the "Upload Documents" navigation item roles from `['admin', 'board_member']` to `['admin']`
- Board members will no longer see the "Upload Documents" link in the sidebar navigation
- Admins continue to see and access the upload functionality

### 2. Document Management Component
**File:** `app/src/components/documents/DocumentManagement.tsx`
- Added conditional rendering to the "Upload Document" button: `{userRole === 'admin' && (...)}` 
- Board members will no longer see the upload button in the document management interface
- All other functionality (view, download, filter, edit, delete) remains available for board members
- Admins retain full access to all document management features including upload

## Impact

### For Board Members:
- ✅ Can still view all published documents
- ✅ Can still download documents
- ✅ Can still filter and search documents
- ❌ Cannot see upload navigation link
- ❌ Cannot see upload button in document management
- ❌ Cannot access upload functionality

### For Administrators:
- ✅ Retain full document upload functionality
- ✅ All existing features work exactly as before
- ✅ Can still upload, manage, and publish documents
- ✅ Have complete control over document management

## Security
- Existing API-level role-based access control remains intact
- No changes to backend security or database permissions
- UI changes only - backend security was already properly implemented
- Board members cannot access upload functionality even through direct URL access (existing protection)

## Testing Completed
- ✅ Board member login: Upload link and button are hidden
- ✅ Admin login: All upload functionality works normally
- ✅ Document viewing/downloading works for both roles
- ✅ No errors or broken functionality introduced

## Files Modified
1. `app/src/components/layout/DashboardSidebar.tsx` - Navigation role restriction
2. `app/src/components/documents/DocumentManagement.tsx` - Upload button conditional rendering

The implementation is clean, minimal, and leverages existing role-based infrastructure without introducing complexity or potential errors.
